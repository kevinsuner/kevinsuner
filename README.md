Kevin is a software engineer working on stuff such as distributed systems, identity management and developer experience. He has been programming since the late 2000s after failing to cheat on a videogame called [Lineage II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineage_II).

In his free time, he likes to work on his own [free and open-source projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/Free_and_open-source_software); which you can find on his blog as it documents some of his work. Here's a [list of projects](https://kevinsuner.com/projects) he has worked over the years. His current hobbies outside programming include simracing, hiking and in the near future playing an instrument.

Carrer wise he would like to start moving from the [Web Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development) space to in his view, a more challenging area like [Computer Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics), [Compilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) or [Operating Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system).
